# guruBotReadMe
Guru bot is a private repo for confidentiality reasons, but the point of the bot is to listen for slack events (@mention the bot). If the bot is mentioned and the question is formatted properly it will create a card in Guru (our internal knowledge repo) for you. 


Please see picture in repo for example.
